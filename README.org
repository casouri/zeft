#+TITLE: Zeft

[[./demo.gif]]

This is a light-weight [[https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/][Deft]] with a different interface. I wanted to use Emacs-builtin input methods and I want a interface closer to Appleâ€™s Note.app. Hence this small package.

* Usage

Type =M-x zeft RET= to bring up the panel. Type the search phrase in the first line. Press =C-n= and =C-p= to go through each file. You can preview a file by pressing =SPC= when the point is on a file, or click the file with the mouse. Press =RET= to open the file in the same window.

Note that:

1. Zeft only looks for first-level files in ~zeft-directory~. Files in sub-directories are not searched.
2. Zeft creates new files by using the search phrase as the filename and title, if you want otherwise, redefine ~zeft-create-note~.
3. Zeft saves the current window configuration before switching to the zeft buffer. When the zeft buffer is killed, Zeft restores the saved window configuration.
4. Zeft only display the first 50 files when the search phrase is empty, if you want to see all the files, force a refresh by typing =C-c C-g=.
